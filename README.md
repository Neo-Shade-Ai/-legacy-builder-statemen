Official statement of JonnyG’s legacy builder history, mission, and development approach since 1997.
# JonnyG – Legacy Builder Statement

I’ve been building software, systems, and AI-integrated tools since 1997.

Before open source was a thing, we:
- Hosted our own servers
- Ran our own backups
- Protected code like currency
- Used real machines, not just GitHub pages

I joined GitHub in 2013 when it became more useful for integration and remote collaboration.  
But my dev journey didn’t start here. It started in the real world — long before cloud repos were popular.

This repo exists to clarify that:
- My GitHub isn’t empty. It’s just not the full picture.
- Code from NeoLegacy and other app builds will be added here **once development is live and protected.**
- I’ve got apps on Replit, tools in production, and AI projects in motion.

I’m not here to fake hype.  
I’m here to **build legacy.**

Stay tuned.
