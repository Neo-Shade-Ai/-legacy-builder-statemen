## 🧠 Development History

> “Before GitHub pages, there were physical servers. Before AI hype, there was raw code.”

JonnyG has been:
- Hosting private infrastructure before cloud was cool
- Running encrypted backups off bare metal
- Building auth systems before OAuth had a name
- Prototyping voice tech before AI had a voice

GitHub became part of the **public-facing footprint in 2013**, but the **real legacy was forged before that** — off-grid, offline, and on real machines.
